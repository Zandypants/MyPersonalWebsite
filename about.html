                        As a kid, I found the most joy in reading books late into the night, solving puzzles of all kinds or playing board games. 
                        Once I found video games it felt as though many of my joys had been combined into one grand experience, 
                        complete with both the stories and the challenges, and tied together with the bow of immersive interaction. 
                        My love for video games is what led me to a passion for development, and persists through adulthood. 
                        Along the way I also picked up Tabletop role-playing games -- often considered the precursors to videogames -- 
                        and found them to be similarly engaging.

                        Every now and again I am compelled to get out of my chair and touch grass. 
                        Exercise keeps the mind and body healthy, but I have found the only way 
                        I can get myself to consistently exercise is by tricking my gamer mind into forgetting about the physical exertion; 
                        sports provide a perfect solution for this. When I am climbing, I am thinking not about the strain of my muscle and the groan of my bones;
                        instead I am focused only on the goal: reaching the top of whatever wall I happen to find myself perched on, be it rock or artificial.
                        Soccer is probably the best cardio of any sport I've played, as well as a great team builder, though I haven't played much since highschool.
                        Chess might be a bit of an outlier in regards to physical exercise, but it is a great mental exercise and officially recognized as a sport 
                        by the International Olympic comittee, so here it is to stay. I also enjoy tennis and more recently pickleball, but I couldn't find any pictures of myself playing them.
